# DEMO: pg_vector

This is a simple proof-of-concept that will use:

* PostgreSQL as a vector database via the PgVector extension.
* Docling for its document chunking ability.
* Pandoc for EPUB-to-Markdown conversion.
* vLLM with DeepSeek Qwen 1.5B for embedding vector generation and
  similarity search.
